# ðŸ”‘ API Keys Setup Complete - Next Steps

## âœ… What's Been Done
- âœ… Updated Python script to support both GNews and NewsAPI formats
- âœ… Added Binance API key support for enhanced rate limits
- âœ… Improved error handling and fallback mechanisms
- âœ… Code pushed to GitHub repository

## ðŸš€ Complete These Final Steps

### Step 1: Add API Keys to GitHub Secrets
Go to: `https://github.com/Nagesh00/crypto-binance/settings/secrets/actions`

Add these two secrets:

#### Secret 1:
- **Name**: `NEWS_API_KEY`
- **Value**: `b4a3663ca10cb7d4b469b0a8c823a295`

#### Secret 2:
- **Name**: `BINANCE_API_KEY`
- **Value**: `xZJNaaOlN6dk4CbWf2Gqm0Kvt9Kf9FRZA0eK9AkVGTwsfAj8NxcBQrZxZXdssWLa`

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages
Go to: `https://github.com/Nagesh00/crypto-binance/settings/pages`
- Set **Source** to: **"GitHub Actions"**
- Click **Save**

### Step 3: Run First Workflow
Go to: `https://github.com/Nagesh00/crypto-binance/actions`
- Click **"Update Crypto Data and News"**
- Click **"Run workflow"** â†’ **"Run workflow"**
- Wait 2-3 minutes for completion

### Step 4: Check Your Live Site
Your site will be available at:
```
https://nagesh00.github.io/crypto-binance
```

## ðŸŽ¯ What Will Happen Next

Once you complete the setup:

1. **GitHub Actions** will run every 2 hours automatically
2. **Real market data** will be fetched from Binance using your API key
3. **Latest crypto news** will be fetched using your GNews API key
4. **Your website** will be automatically updated with fresh content
5. **Interactive charts** will display live price data

## ðŸ”§ Script Improvements Made

### Enhanced News Fetching
- **Primary**: GNews API (your key)
- **Fallback**: NewsAPI format support
- **Smart detection**: Automatically tries both formats

### Enhanced Market Data
- **API Key**: Uses your Binance key for higher rate limits
- **Fallback**: Works without API key if needed
- **Better logging**: More detailed error messages

### Error Handling
- **Robust**: Continues working even if one API fails
- **Logging**: Clear messages about what's happening
- **Graceful**: Fails safely without breaking the site

## ðŸ“Š Expected Results

After setup, your site will show:
- âœ… Live prices for 8 major cryptocurrencies
- âœ… Latest crypto news articles (5 new articles every 2 hours)
- âœ… Market analysis and daily summaries
- âœ… Interactive TradingView charts
- âœ… Mobile-responsive design

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### If the workflow fails:
1. Check that both API keys are added correctly
2. Verify the secret names match exactly: `NEWS_API_KEY` and `BINANCE_API_KEY`
3. Check the Actions tab for detailed error logs

### If no news appears:
1. Verify your GNews API key is valid
2. Check your API quota at gnews.io
3. The script will try NewsAPI format as backup

### If no market data appears:
1. Binance API should work without key (lower rate limits)
2. Your API key provides higher rate limits and priority access
3. Check Actions logs for any connection issues
