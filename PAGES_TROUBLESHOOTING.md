# GitHub Pages Troubleshooting Guide

## üö® Issue: GitHub Pages Not Showing Site

### üìã STEP-BY-STEP FIX:

#### 1. **Enable GitHub Pages**
Go to: https://github.com/Nagesh00/crypto-binance/settings/pages

#### 2. **Configure Source**
- **Source**: Select **"GitHub Actions"** 
- **NOT** "Deploy from branch"
- **NOT** "Jekyll"

#### 3. **Add API Keys (Critical)**
Go to: https://github.com/Nagesh00/crypto-binance/settings/secrets/actions

Add these Repository Secrets:
```
Name: NEWS_API_KEY
Value: b4a3663ca10cb7d4b469b0a8c823a295

Name: BINANCE_API_KEY  
Value: xZJNaaOlN6dk4CbWf2Gqm0Kvt9Kf9FRZA0eK9AkVGTwsfAj8NxcBQrZxZXdssWLa
```

#### 4. **Check Repository Visibility**
- Repository must be **Public** for GitHub Pages (free tier)
- If private, upgrade to GitHub Pro

#### 5. **Monitor Deployment**
- Go to: https://github.com/Nagesh00/crypto-binance/actions
- Check if "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow is running
- Look for any error messages

### üîß IMMEDIATE ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION:

If GitHub Actions isn't working, I can create a simple Jekyll setup:

1. **Use Jekyll Theme** (simpler deployment)
2. **Create basic index.md** (instead of complex HTML)
3. **Use GitHub's built-in Jekyll**

### üìû QUICK CHECK:

1. Is your repository **PUBLIC**?
2. Have you **enabled GitHub Pages** in settings?
3. Did you select **"GitHub Actions"** as source?
4. Have you **added the API keys** to secrets?

### üåê Expected URL:
https://nagesh00.github.io/crypto-binance
