# üöÄ GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

## Current Issue
You're seeing Node.js/Jekyll options but no website deployment. This means GitHub Pages isn't configured correctly.

## ‚úÖ Correct Setup Steps

### 1. Set GitHub Pages Source
Go to: `https://github.com/Nagesh00/crypto-binance/settings/pages`

**IMPORTANT**: In the **"Source"** section, you must select:
- ‚úÖ **"GitHub Actions"** ‚Üê SELECT THIS
- ‚ùå NOT "Deploy from a branch"

### 2. What You Should See
After selecting "GitHub Actions":
- ‚úÖ You'll see: "GitHub Actions" selected as source
- ‚úÖ Below it: "Use a workflow from your repository"
- ‚úÖ It should mention: "Jekyll" workflow detected

### 3. Add Your API Keys (If Not Done)
Go to: `https://github.com/Nagesh00/crypto-binance/settings/secrets/actions`

Add these secrets:
- **NEWS_API_KEY**: `b4a3663ca10cb7d4b469b0a8c823a295`
- **BINANCE_API_KEY**: `xZJNaaOlN6dk4CbWf2Gqm0Kvt9Kf9FRZA0eK9AkVGTwsfAj8NxcBQrZxZXdssWLa`

### 4. Trigger Deployment
Go to: `https://github.com/Nagesh00/crypto-binance/actions`
- Click "Deploy Jekyll site to Pages"
- Click "Run workflow" button
- Click "Run workflow" (green button)

### 5. Check Deployment
- Wait 2-3 minutes for workflow to complete
- Your site will be available at: `https://nagesh00.github.io/crypto-binance`

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If you still don't see GitHub Actions option:
1. Make sure repository is **public** (private repos need GitHub Pro)
2. Make sure you're in the correct repository
3. Try refreshing the page
4. Check if you have admin permissions on the repo

### If GitHub Actions is grayed out:
1. Repository must be public for free GitHub accounts
2. Or you need GitHub Pro/Team for private repos

### If workflow fails:
1. Check that API keys are added correctly
2. Look at the Actions tab for error logs
3. Make sure both secrets are named exactly: `NEWS_API_KEY` and `BINANCE_API_KEY`

## üì∏ What GitHub Pages Should Look Like

**Source Section Should Show:**
```
Source: GitHub Actions ‚úì
Use a workflow from your repository to build and deploy your site.

‚úì Jekyll workflow detected in .github/workflows/jekyll.yml
```

**NOT:**
```
Source: Deploy from a branch
Branch: main / master
```

**The key is selecting "GitHub Actions" as the source - this enables our custom workflow with crypto data fetching!**
